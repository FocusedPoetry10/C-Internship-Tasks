## Task 2: Rock Paper Scissors using C++

### Overview

In this task, I developed a simple console-based game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using C++. The game allows the user to play against the computer, with both sides choosing between rock, paper, and scissors. The program determines the winner based on standard game rules.

### Features

- **User Input:** The player selects their choice from a menu of options.
- **Random Computer Choice:** The computer's choice is generated randomly.
- **Result Display:** The game displays both the user's and computer's choices and announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

### Code Highlights

- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user input is within the valid range (1 to 3).
- **Random Choice Generation:** Uses the C++ `rand()` function to generate the computer's choice.
- **Winner Determination:** Compares the choices and determines the outcome based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

### Example

Here's how the game looks in action:

1. Rock
2. Paper
3. Scissors
- Enter your choice (1, 2, 3): 1
- You chose: **Rock**
- Computer chose: **Scissors**
- **You win!**

# Conclusion
This task helped me practice basic C++ concepts such as input handling, random number generation, and conditional statements. The game provides a fun and interactive way to apply these skills.

Feel free to check out the code and try it out!
