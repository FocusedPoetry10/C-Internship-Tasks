# Task 1: Guess the Number using C++

## Description

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in C++. The program generates a random number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

## Features

- Random number generation within a specified range.
- User input for guessing the number.
- Feedback on each guess (too high, too low, correct).
- Count of the number of attempts made by the player.
- Option to play again after guessing the correct number.
